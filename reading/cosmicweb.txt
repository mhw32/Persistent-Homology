Voronoi Tessellations and the Cosmic Web: Spatial Patterns and Clustering across the Universe (Rien van de Weygaert)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The spatial cosmic matter distribution = pervasive foamlike pattern. 
Voroni Tesselations = a way in math to represent web patterns.

This is due to low-density expanding void regions + matter assembles in high density filaments between the voids.

Galaxies conglomerate into weblike patterns. Thus, it is not homogenous. There are big filamentary and big sheetlike structures. The intersection of these sheets and filaments = more noticeable object in the Universe. Conversely there are also large void = regions without any galaxy. There are usually round in shape. These things are really not randomly scattered, there seems to be a very definite weblike shape.

You can think of a voronoi tessellation as the skeleton of the cosmic matter distribution = structural frame. Because the universe is domintated by expanding voids, it's perfect. Interior of cells = voids, plans = walls of galaxies. Verticies = very dense compact nodes of the cosmic web.

** I'm guessing we can just generate voronoi tessellations as simulations... and work with that? Like a toy model.

This can only address galaxy distribution on large scale.

Gravitational instability = shaped the universe from a perfectly smooth featureless cosmos to this web tihng. All started with gravitational pull frmo tiny initial densities.

Void evolution : Voids grow. They merge, or get destroyed. We can think of the  cosmic web as close packing of spherically expanding regions.  = equally sized of equally fast expanding spherical voids. These cluster by themselves = grow our voronoi units. Do this via voronoi clustering.

** Why equally sized.
