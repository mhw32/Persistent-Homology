STATISTICAL TOPOLOGICAL DATA ANALYSIS USING PERSISTENCE LANDSCAPES
Peter Bubenik
------------------------------------------------------------------

Landscapes are a more processable form of standard topology summaries.
There is difficulty in comparing persistence diagrams with statistics and machine learning. The landscape = is a function (calculations here are much faster than with persistence diagram).

Roughly, homology in degree 0 describes the connectedness of the
data; homology in degree 1 detects holes or tunnels; homology in degree 2 captures voids;

Basic idea = convert barcode into a function. 
Geometry of persistence diagrams are super hard to worth with. Space of persistence languages are really a lot easier. 

Seems like a continuous 2D projection. This is cool but don't we lose any information? Also how does this compare with bottleneck distances? How does one perform t-tests on top of this? 

Landscapes = sequence of continuous piecewise linear functions that encode a persistence diagram (But don't lose dimensionality?) Linear curves are overlayed. How do you compare these tihngs?

**Not a single idea what silhouttes do. Probably just another way to summarize persistence diagrams.
