    <h1>Topological Hypothesis Tests for Large-Scale Structure</h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        Rigorous comparisons of spatially complex data such as the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe is notoriously difficult due, in part, to the difficulty in capturing the randomness of geometric and topological structures.  However, these comparisons are important as it is becoming apparent that there is potentially information about cosmological parameters in the structure. We propose a framework for constructing  topological hypothesis tests using ideas from an emerging area of topological data analysis called persistent homology. Persistent homology offers a novel way to represent, visualize, and interpret complex data by extracting topological features, which can be used to infer properties of the underlying structures, and has already been used as an exploratory tool for some problems in astronomy among other areas of science.

        In the field of astronomy, Van de Weygaert et. al.  studied the topology of both the  simple heuristic Voronoi clustering models and the Megaparsec Cosmic Web (LCDM simulation) using tools from algebraic topology, such as Betti numbers and Alpha shapes.  The Betti numbers are a topological invariant that counts the number of n-dimensional holes in a space.  In this paper, we are considering structures in three dimensions such that the holes represent components (n=0), loops (n=1), and voids (n=2). Van de Weygaert et. al. further studied the evolution of the Betti numbers at different scales in the context of alternative dark energy assumptions behind LCDM simulations by looking at the persistent homology (a multi-scale view of homology at which topological features arise through multiple scales of time and/or space).

        In this paper, we move beyond the ideas introduced towards quantitatively detailing the topological and geometric differences between the observable Universe under respective assumptions of cold and warm dark matter. The predominant thought is that cold dark matter, by having less kinetic energy, moves slower and leads to the formation of more LSS. Provided with the EAGLE simulations, we want to provide strict numbers to measure the differences in topological features. Such a framework could inform insights into the effects of dark matter and its properties. To quantify topological differences, we create a hypothesis testing framework to compare functional summaries of persistence diagrams that generalize to any point cloud data set. The hypothesis testing framework is tested and verified on a set of Voronoi foam models where the true distribution of persistence diagrams is known. Using the EAGLE data set, we propose a form of bootstrapping called splicing to artificially expand a data set. Using the hypothesis testing framework, we find that while the CDM and WDM assumptions produce similar topological features globally, they contain statistically significant geometric and topological differences in smaller scale splits.
