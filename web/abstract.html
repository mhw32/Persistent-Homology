  <p>
    Much of the definitions of the observable Universe and dark matter are heavily based on assumptions. Provided this uncertainty, one approach to gaining understanding of the true structure of the Universe is through cosmological simulations. Recent simulations from the EAGLE project have separated the Universe under warm and cold dark matter assumptions. Scientifically, it is believed that warm and cold dark matter have contrasting physical properties. This paper attempts to present a hypothesis testing framework to quantify the differences and similarities between warm and cold dark matter to a statistical precision.
